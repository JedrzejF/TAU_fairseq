Return on the very American ideal of the labour rights of old human rights
The congressation of Keith Ellison and John Leishabes introduced in order to establish the organization of trade unionists als civil law.
"For example, such as trade unionists sterben, also die Mittelklassejobs," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and Deputy Chairperson of the Progressive Caucus in the Congress.
I am proud to be proud jointly with the Civil Law Cone John League.
This lawful law gives workers the equilibrium of discrimination in the way of discrimination, the organisation of trade unions, such as the other forms of discrimination - and stop so antiunion in the same way as in other forms of discrimination.
The addition of the national legislative law in order to provide an opportunity for an unlawful and necessary initiative.
Aber is certainly not a radicale initiative - any case not to American standards.
In fact, the best art and wisdom is the best art and wisdom, what Ellison, League, and the sponsored sponsors of her legislative proposal to return to a very American idea.
Trotz of the background, the trade unionists in the past year - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states in the whole country - have encouraged countries in all the world to recognise and observe labour law.
There was one time that millions of Americans were still reminded of millions of Americans, als this country of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, freedom of movement, freedom of movement, freedom of movement, freedom of movement, freedom of movement.
Als the associates after the Second World War Japan after World War II, encouraged General Double-Mac Arthur and his Stab to adopt a Constitution, which ensures that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos by democracy.

Als this country in other countries in the country in the country in the country of the country in the country of the country in the country of the country in the country to be protected by the right to the founding of the trade union - and daring the trade union dann to collective bargains.
It is true that the American ideal will have to have the right to reunited the American ideal to reinvigorate the American ideal back to the work of the people who have had the right to associate themselves and to have the right to unite and open societies.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. before fifty years:
The story is a great teacher in the history of the city.
Jetzt All, dass the movement of labor movement does not limit the strengths of the nation.
By raising the standard of living standards of millions of people have done work on wonderful wisdom in the market for the industry and the whole nation on unimaginable levels of production levels.
Those who attacked the work, forget this very simple truths, but the history retains them.
The history reminds us and we should also do that.
The formal recognition of the rights of human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights against discrimination in the creation of workers - is lengthy.
Keith Ellison and John Leader's ideals, the America in the past, and the promises of democracy.

Als Advisory Anästhesiearzt, he devoid his career as a carrider of the task, the agonie of illness as well as the quality of treatment.
Under the patient’s patients, the woman, was a MI6-employee who had to live with the devastating impact of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are aware of the diagnosis and illness are important to the diagnosis and illness.
One day in 2007 he was one day in 2007, he was the same thing that he did in 2007.
"Ich did not feel feeling," he wrote in Mai this year.
Ich has been able to finalise the difficulties.
On the other hand, he has been fighting with the grippesimilar symptoms.
"Ich wants to stay at the end of the late.
Als Juliet for one week on one of the business travellers, Lawson feels quite unusual and worrying.

Statements and local tax deprivation for businesses in the country in the past year.
Companies in District District, Maryland and Virginia paid $27.6 billion $27,6 billion dollars in the financial year 2013, a rise to 3.8% compared to the revenue of 2012.
The state-owned and local tax burden rose by 4.3 percent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per year, compared to 3.9% in the year and it was the third year of growth in the year after the multiannual year after the multiannual year after the majority of years.

More als the halfte of the district tax revenue of the district, 56 percent, from corporate taxes, currencies from corporate taxes, currencies of Marylands from companies.
Virginia achieved with 28 percent of the lowest tax revenue from enterprise.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is justified in recovering the real estate values of the enterprise, says, the researchers, which led to an increase of 3.7% in this year after the three successive successive years after the three successive years after the three successive years after the three successive years after the three successive successive growth rates of lesser als 1%.
In the meantime, a large part of this professor of big state such as California, New York and Texas, seem to be attributed to Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid over 10 billion dollars to state-owned and local real estate taxes, compared to 9.6 billion dollars in the past year, compared to 9.6 billion $ 2012.
Aber the seemingly recovered recovery in real estate values is not so effective in Maryland in Maryland is not so effective in the increase of public and local tax revenues.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. contributors almost half the half.
"In Maryland, the following: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area at D.C., is dispaved in the possession of the government of non-profit organizations, which paid no real estate taxes.
Maryland is forced to have a lot more on income taxes, in order to offer a lot more on income taxes, in order to offer the same services.
The recently recovered recovery in the tax revenue by companies cannot be equitable for the recovery of the real estate market.
Business revenue seems to be recovered as a result of the data.

Maryland nahm 1 billion in business income taxes, the highest amount of the region's highest amount.
At the end of the trend in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase the local tax burden on companies in three places.
The increase in the districts in the district, with 4.3 percent of the national average, currencies in Maryland significantly higher than 4.9 percent.
Nur Virginia reported an average tax income of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has 6 percent in all three areas of office, the most significant business income taxes (in all the three areas).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is an 8.25 percent and in the district, 9.975 percent.
In addition to comparative Studies of the US Chamber of Commerce at Beginning this year, dass in Virginia a lower state and local corporate taxes.
In the Study of District was not investigated.
Strtz of the advantages, Virginia is under pressure through its southwestern neighbours.
North Carolina has passed Gesetze to cut its corporate tax rates in this year by 6.9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% in the coming year.
Wenn der State continues to achieve income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate by 2017 to 3% by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be better to do so in Washington, and it pays more nationally and local taxes, so the younger study.
Business taxes, the als personalised income taxes by small business leute - one-sided transition structure, after which the majority of small businesses are organized by small businesses - in the district, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent to 2.4 billion to $2.4 billion to $2.4 billion to $2.4 billion annually.
The researchers have said that the Trend and the increase in corporate governance in the whole country in the whole country in this year, with an increase in the general tax revenue for the government and the local government and the local government and the local governments.
The area of Washington, the area of Washington, if the expulsion of the federal government in the region.

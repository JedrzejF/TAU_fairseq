Clintons and Trump’s economic policy in comparison with It's all about the money
In infrastructure investments and the trade agreements TTP prevents the fact that Clinton als also Trump.
Uneing, the US presidential assessment of the tax and energy policy as well as in one basic question in the tax and energy policy.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
This is the role of the state.
Trump will be small and warned about how the state of the economy can damage the state of the economy - with taxes and regulators.
Clinton wool the economy to death and regulate deaths.
He will not be able to wear, Trump.
He will have a massive decline in tax reform with lower tax rates, and it makes it possible for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates.
Clinton against saying: the state has set certain tasks, he has given disadvantages and will need money for money.
Outside the taxes for the Reichen increase, they say.
Interesting evidence is very close to the Thema infrastructure.
In the meantime, Trump and Clinton.
The democratic, candidate in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical, democratic, democratic policy and will be stripped to the state of affairs of the Republicans.
On Trump, there can be a partial discussion on Trump.
Clearly the differences in energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and the coal promotion in the US.
Oil promotion should also be possible in a long protected area and the Paris climate.
Clinton against his investment programme will express the Renewable Energy Renewable Energy, and called "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.
"It will probably be the Chinae, Germanland of America - I will, let us know thing.'
Doch not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements are not only far from each other.
TPP, the transpazifish trade agreements; they do not want to sign up.
But the US does not want to isolate international trade in isolation - but only American jobs.
This should also be better paid for a better paid path, about Clinton.
The current minimum of 7.25 US dollar is a hunger reward.
He wants to increase in 15 dollars per hour.
Was Trump wants to do in this question; it is not quite clear: once said that the minimum of the muscles rauf, dann says, he should not change it.
Doch the great discussion of the coming months will probably have to develop the tax policy of void camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants the economy and the citizens to boost growth.
Seine critics believe that the budget deficit would only be greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who is at least demanding the Reichen at least of the Reichen at least of the Reichen and the critics saying: more taxes are not the solution.

Russia and Turkey.
It was a gesture that ended up in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey have met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands of Russia and Turkey’s leaders, and an official end of the eighth months of the word and economic sanctions.
Aber als Vladimir Putin in Turkish opponents in the golden Saal of the St.Petersburger Palastes in reception, I cannot deny the reconciliation.
There have been a crash, ja.
Aber Putin’s smile is a mallippig and he radiated the proportional proportional proportions.
Relief Tayya Erdogan said that he said "lijust friend" Putin - is a report of five Male.
Ich could no longer be counted.
He promised the relationship with Russia not only to him from the crisis before the crisis.
On the next day of the day, Erdogan had so been, als have never had a worse.
I seemed to say his enthusiasm to the contrary.
Aber one of Putin, a sustainable chick, the leader of the Russian leader of Russia.
Much more has been the cause of the crisis that he mentioned in his introduction: the fall of Russian campaign to the Syrian border by Turkey.
MMoscow's reaction to the time was wutental.
Putin participated in and accused Ankara, Russia in return.
The evasion was even greater, because it was started by a supposed friend.
The Vetrauen once again will become more difficult if not as possible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
Monate long the state of the state controlled media are fierce and unrestricted access to Ankara.
Once again, the Turks were guilty of the Turks for all.
On the serious series, the allegations of senior officials, dass Erdogan’s own family’s own Familie vom illegalen oil trafficking in Syria.
He has played this very vehement.
Aber in St.Petersburg, the official ambassador to the official message.
Clearly fand this meeting took place only after a half time, weil Putin vom President Erdogan, which he wanted to heard.
Russia had been able to book the Art Sieg.
For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire.
Erdogan, in the first line all the friend, which he can come; after his last month he was almost unsuccessful.
Real terrorist attacks on Turkey.
Aber there is also an economic motivation.
Russian sanctions, Turkey hard, particularly the prohibition of charterflow, the ban on charterflow, which will bring more millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.
The number is almost 90 % decline.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are readily increased.
They count on a late seasonal season in the Mediterranean.
This week predicted the state television forest, the public television forest, and vegetables, sobald the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed to be allowed.
A report in Vedemos formulated the following road: "tourist", Tomaten here lang."
Aber of the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is on the West, because it is a reaction to the attempted transfer of als weak response.
The continued Groll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the depletion of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the depletion of benefits and reducing Turkey’s relationship with Turkey.
The Russian leader won in Ankara with security in Ankara with security in Ankara.
This is a good self-understanding of the self-evident, who himself had a deep fear of regime change.
The summits in this glossy palace on the sea, the Russians and Turkey.
Nevertheless, the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the void of the public reconciliation.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow, in short, the role of the peace of peace, but where Russia and Turkey’s opposing sides.
It may be marked by almost three hours of first talks on the press conference.
The President of Turkey’s President to respond to one question about him.
There is no unequivocally consensus, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
Aber after Monaten of open enemies - and tending the potential for a perfect disastery, als the NATO member Turkey.

They are not asking anyone.
Other points would be discussed in the first half of the parties.
I would like to take a look at it.
Als Interior Minister for Home Affairs is a result of the results and in the "commercial" consens" inside the coalition.
De Maizière, after the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach have made a little time before presenting conclusions on the security in the Republic.
But the fall in the case of a large scale.
Uniges is already known, proclaim, indicate: Dass is a new security authority to take care of the knees of encrypted communications is not new.
Auch does not have to implement the facts, the Germany’s country had to transpose more EU charges on passenger data and arms law.
The Right for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities will not be surprised.
In order to form part of Maizière, the second race for proposals that have not been made with the SPD to be made with the SPD to become a sympathy for terrorist groups and jihadises with double citizenship.
"This will be a swim point for the SPD", the CDU man.
He halted this trotzd for reasonable and demanding that the coalition partners have no chance of having a coalitional partner.
A couple of new ideas presented by Maizière too.
It is clear that he is planning fast procedures for deportation and more opportunities for deportation and more opportunities for imprisonment of people from deportation.
Frichtlinge, which will be targeted to the country beforehand, before the Smartphones, and the Social-Media-Accounts for a security review.
In the case of Duldungen for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to dispose of the offences of the asylum seeker to disguise them.
One of them is politically and legitimate.
Menches are still unspoiled and disbursed frames.
Und on certain points - for the inequalities of patience - the question: Was has the question: Was has the question: Was has the right to do so.
Yes, Mr Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees, and terror.
Aber is not in Abrede, the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg refugees.
In addition, many people have made a lot of people in the high numbers of refugees.
Und Dinge, which people are deeply concerned about the people of the people who are deeply involved in election campaigns.
Internal security is enormously in the focus.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood are: Paris, Kopenhagen, Brussel, Nice.
Dann the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
There is a great deal of uncertainty.
Und jaw, there are election campaigns.
Union and SPD will be the subject of insecurity in the subject of domestic security.

Only a garstiger of the refunding, the Federal Police and the Security Policy Ideen-Samlung Unions-Interior Department in which the Ressortchefs also called a Burka-prohibition, and reversal of double citizenship.
De Maizière is also a reconciliatory killing.
Von a one-off return vom double pass.
We have met the discussion in Germany’s country.
You will not be able to reinvigorate is not useful.
Und the Burka-prohibition, he has constituted constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package of all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually "presumed "mutable" is for the coalition partner.
It can be found in the room that can be used for the whole of the world.
The SPD also tries to benefit from the issue of intra-security issues.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signalizes only cautious readiness and saying: "The SPD is prepared to talk about what contributes to improving safety.

Inmitts of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins
Wherever you are in the same way as spy it to the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro will feel constant and unavoidable, a rasender Staffellon between Competition and Street.
It is the olympische Fackel is a burning stone, the vom armbrusts, the vom armbrusts.
You can not listen to the television, one time to read or listen to your neighborhoods in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop in the Coffeshop on
Und dann, there is still Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the zum came to the Olympic Games and a women-warm warm with grebchen with greeners, had been ended.
Aber Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the Olympic Trampoline turn.
The olympic flame does not illuminate any event.
Join the shadows in the shade of the sports arts, which are not universally recognized: air pistolenschiet, Bogenshoot, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimmen and is a long time.
Aber if I am modestly arguments for me to make a modesty of the trampolin’s discrete.
The trampoline jump has been a olympic event since 2000, als it in Sydney, the last 16 years, the last 16 years have been so sharply true.
This could also be regional ignorance.
While the US has sent athletes to compete with athletes in the trampoline springs, and by 2012 to the end run.
The Chinese and the Russians are neigen, the price for men and the Chinese and the Canary Islands.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada, this year will defend Goldmedal from London.
The trampoline jump has a certain external seitercharme, part white and weil it for the inenlightened ear ear to the Olympic Games for the Olympic Game.
On this point, I should like to give me no expertise, but I do not pass an expert, but only one of the most popular enthusiasm.
It has humoristic potentials - the cartoonary quotation never wanted to endanger the pralls - but also the Grade of the tournament and divestiture that combines two sports arts, which combines two sports arts.
The word "Trampolin" from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much as "springboard."
Rumb winners, jumping on a gigantic trampoline trampoline trampoline, almost up to 30 foot in the air and must take part in the air.
They will be an official Olympia programme after implementation, difficulty grad and "flight times".
The two-fold athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will be in Rio.
The most common olympic vector is straight out.
Medaillenhopes must be passed on to gold, fastery, after observing and drüver, manchmal to the goal.
They are not only the target line odes the starting conversion, sondern in television transmission, also a further higher target of the Olympiarekords.
The targeted pursuit is nobel, admirable, admirable and even fanatically - and it is enough to prevent the spectators to tears.
Aber it is also what I feel at the spectators of this player.
Davion offers the trampolin insert Atempause.
The vector of the trampoline jump is obsolete.
One of the warming movement is not the target.
He odes them prallt about, seemingly difficult as a astronomy as a astronomy as a astronomy as a astronomy as a astronomy.
Auch here is a competitor, self-evidently not without any difficulty but currency, there is no hektiful attack on the goal, no wolves in the Ferne, only the dreamerische, elegant lifts of time and heavy power.
It is so Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games.
The qualification and Endrunden of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming of 1300 Easter Time; that of the men on Saturday and 1300.
NBC will broadcast the Endrunden als part of one afternoon block from 14.00.
Inmittedly the Olympia many, they are quiet.

NASA Klimamodell: Venus was inhabited
The Venus was the projection of a new NASA Klimamodells.
Research on Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the history of the Venus with tools and algorithms.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus hot water, water loses and carbon dioxide atmospheric condition.
Scientists have been suggesting that the slower rotation of Venus by him in the heart of the surroundings.
Aber the latest simulation indicates that the venues of the venue.
The model also highlights the topography of early Venuse.
It was probably more dry counterpart als de Erde , but hatched enough water and geographic variability to protect life and protect life and protect life and protect life and protect life and protect life and protect them from faster evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from one Sonne, the 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS-model simulation exponiate the slower rotation of Venus ihre Day page of the Sonne almost two months.
This erupts the surface and produces rainy rain that creates a diameter of the sunlight.
The result is the average temperature of cooler als are the most cool cooler als.
The model brought a story of Venus, which resembles the evolution of evolution, which was suspected of evolution.
While it was suspected that the Venus -- in the running of several billion years --too much Hitze and ultraviolet light.
Home oceans dared and its water damage, vom ultraviolet light.
Als their hydrogen is only a dictionary atmosphere of carbon dioxide with one of the lethal greenhouse gases -- the Venuse, which we know today.

A lot of stars in this star house created by rand 125 million years ago, the adult age.
They are now on the fastest.
At top rotational rats, this matching sterling mortality in starving.
Because this winds are travelled by the Magnetfelder of the stars, they had a brake effect on the sternee.

Erwischt: Wegen eines positive.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the most official doping accidents.
The Athletin had won almost one Medaille.
Before the seventh race day, the most official doping accidents, the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The chinese swimming pool in Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre barrier in Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the polnische weighthever Adrian target in Brazil.
When Chen had already been the diuretics of hydrochlorothiazide, the als maskierendes for doping substances.
The Internationale Sportgerichtshof CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-olds had the fourth place in the finale over 100 metres of metterling, only 0.09 seconds, they missed the bronze emedaille.
On Friday, Chen had to take part in the precursor of more than 50 metres of free trade.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the opening of the B-Probe and a hearing.
The national association holds the matter "very serious" and requires full cooperation in the investigations", quoted Xinhua from one participation: "We will collaborate with the International Sports Tribunal CAS.
For the first time in the history is no longer the IOC, sondern of the CAS for the sanctioning of the athletes with positive cases.
At the night of Rio, the night of Rio sickery, the positive sample in Danekowa , the 33-year olds ging damit even in Offensive.

Data to be used by the Hacker of her holy money.
Programmes of blackmail malwares are more accurately targeted at companies in and sind as well.
In the case of the Malware-Abwehr-Specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany; 40 percent of the beaten companies in the past 12 months.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies are already committed to the ransomal blackmail.
40 percent of the victims paid by the perpetrators required by the perpetrators.
The perpetrators specializes in the software is the observer of Malwarebytes is the observer of malwarebytes on attacks.
If they succeed, the potential to blackmail the potential to blackmail payments.
"We are witnessed at the topical evolutionary of the damage software", Malwarebytes-Chef Marcus Kleczynski in talks with the "World ".
In 2008, the means of Malwareprogrammes are still outstanding.
Dann discovered the perpetrators of blackmail software.
Only warn private users of the goal, the change to corporate attacks.
Rransomware works after a simple same: Once on the computer.
This file is encrypted by the ransomware and deletes the original.
To conclude, the software presents the demands of the pressers.
To get the final turnkey code to the films, the victims’ money - is in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
Doch where private users understand the personal photo-database on the game, it is in the case of sensitive customer data odes project databases, commodities of the project database.
Accordingly, the damage caused by the damage to the damage when one ransomware.
22 percent of the affected companies melted revenue losses caused by ransomware, 13 percent had to break the business activity completely.
In Germany, the majority of the hospitals of victims of attacks, patient patients through the loss of health acts.
"We have forgot the victims, but it is only the problem", Kleczynski.
Doch 80 to 90 percent of the company that has been payed, will come back to it.
For manager, it is difficult to reject the call for the perpetrators.
The hacker will be aware of the and trying to build a good reputation.
In one of the latest studies, the safety researcher of F-Secure’s security researchers.
They declare their victims, as they can be paid by Bitcoin via Bitcoin.
Und private people will have to pay for the payment of less hundreds of euros in order to get rid of the amount of money in order to get rid of the data encrypted.
In the face of the potentially hostile and relatively, risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are always professionally and participate in the work that explains security experts in the Wisniewski vom Antivirus vom Antivirus Sophos: "Ine individual person can enter into ransomware.
Probably it is the most likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers sell him damage, in the form of a software construction box in the form of a software tree in the form of a software construction box in the form of a software component of the software.
The current Malware-Kits has been created and the Malware Self, Advisory and Additional Tools for one-off and more than 1000 and 10.000 dollars.
"In the scope of delivery is an adjustment stool, sodass small-scale configurations, loop and fire.
The depressers are looking for further hackers to disseminate the newly purchased software under the victims.
We live in the service sector.
You are logged in one of the forums in the underground, purchases the use of a criminal and envoy the software to be installed on a wide range of PCs.
The payment has been made per infected invoice.
"Extensive evidence of the criminals dann spammer with the dissemination ", Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware. The risk of ransomware.
Over 50% of the company’s IT responsibilities in the Malwarebytes-survey, ransomware.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are being prepared for new strategies.
"Wenn die encryption of data only a non-sufficient threat to success for successful depessation is more istent, threatens the perpetrators of sensitive data such as customer lists othe price calculation.
At that time, the potential for damages depending on the Art of the data.
Auch, the perpetrators of the future are completely new targets on the Internet of the thefs.
On the hackerkonference Defcon demonstrated security research as they could have been connected with the Internet.
Mitte in winter, the freelolding can be blocked in the winter.
Wenn die perpetrater dann analog instead of the heating in the future.

Walking trees, a paar linear tree, forced the rest of the city in Berlin-Friedrichshain on the first glance of the city in Berlin-Friedrichshain.
Go the streets of Osten to West, you will get back to the West, you will come to play on playgrounds, a fresh freshed child garages and a biolade.
In the façade of the Val Gardena, someone has been "ugsslich!".
On the other side of Lidl, which should also be cleaned as soon as 2017 will be built on a house with hostile windows and 133 new rental apartments.
Articles on this "trendigen Stadtteil", as the agreed real estate company Friedrichshain, will be given in the last few weeks in the last few weeks.
The house with Number 94: Einst was occupied with the number 94: Einst was occupied with the number 94: Einst was occupied by the ground floor and will be used for events.
Particular of the Berlin Innensenator Henkel has had several times in favour of a harbor of the police against the project, the counterd als "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 als starting point for autonomous violence.
On 22 Juni the ruminants in the ground floor with 300 police offices, with 300 police officers, with 300 police officials, the police are waiting for three weeks of official failings with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team-wages.
Recently refurbished construction works on behalf of the unknown householders.
On 13 July, a Berliner Administrative Administration, dass the premises of illegal, and one day later, the police and construction workers under the Jubel of sympathisers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street peacefully: Elterns with children.
In the immediate vicinity of the house project was built in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.
Leke violence is not the main orthogenic residence: Kerstin Neubuiler, who lived in Kiez since 1999; and Jana*, who are here three children from the police.
With the inhabitants of the house project they share the range from rising rentals and gentlemen.
It does not sound after a pine that is a majority of police protection against vandalous lefts.
The Graben, which the Berliner Innensenator and the police between house occupants and their neighbouring neighbours, existently nothing.
Friedrichshain in the Osten Berlins was a traditional working quarter, which has also been a lower average income and high poverty risks.
Auch house occupations and the dared housing projects are already a long term in Kiez: 1990, a number of prisoners in the former GDR, the mainland road to the entire mainland street.
On the other hand, the mainland under a large police force in one of the most regulated streets, which warned many of the projects in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them before 26 years.
Equally the district part of the last year is becoming increasingly popular for tourists and election berliners from all over the world: with them to participate in DDR newspapers and ehemalige householders.
This makes it remarkable for the rentals that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.
Multiple Neubauts in the Riga will be attacked for this development: they are recognized, they are recognized, they are recognized.
Keine elsee street, this year is so often mentioned in the words "leftautonome violence'.
One reason for this, hatred not all neighbouring the als problem, they may not be unconditioned by criminality: criminals such as body injury is not unconditioned by criminality: criminals such as body injury.
The largest part of the offences of the offences that tend to take the newer and freshly renovated houses.

Deswegen was so important; it was also so important to return the residents of the street in July: Von of the police, politics and the media that all sudden the clarity of the city in July.
Doch in the eyes of residents such as Neubuiler will pass on the road: By gesichtslose Neubauten in a former construction gap, the old inhabitants.
"The sind is the ultimate property of ownership that is not interesting here - here we are living in Leute, who is not so good.
"Violence and destruction" I do not have a gutheiro."
Aber what should you say if you never listen to someone who will never hear anyone?
As a result of all sides of frustration, including the police and the inhabitants.
For Zugezogene, which arose over color bombs around, Kerstin Neubauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene.
Anyone who herself should be deliberately aware - just as someone who draws in a Kneippenquarter, is a bad thing about noise.
